Hand Gesture Real-time Digit Recognition using Residual Network and CNN
The code uses Residual Neural Network model to predict hand gesture digit recogition from 0 to 5

The data.zip file has the images on hand gestures. You can also create your own dataset by runnig the collect-data.py code and taking webcam images
Run the Residual Network.ipynb file to create resnet model. I had run this code on AWS t2.micro EC2 instance for 20 mins

To predict run MacCam_resnet_predict.py and it will open your webcam
